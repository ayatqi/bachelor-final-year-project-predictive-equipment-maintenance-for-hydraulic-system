ðŸ”§ Predictive Maintenance for Hydraulic Systems

This project applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict maintenance needs in hydraulic systems. By analyzing sensor data, it identifies failure patterns and correlations between condition variables. Models like Random Forest, CatBoost, and LSTM are evaluated using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy. The project also includes a Power BI dashboard for visualizing system health and component performance.
